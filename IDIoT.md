# IDIoT

## Industry Driven Internet of Things (IDIoT)

This definition includes all the Internet connected objects whose
firmware, communication protocols are secret to the user.

These devices are dangerous for users' privacy and security and can be
fully remotely controlled by the company who manifactured them.

In many cases IDIoT owners use internet services provided by the manifacturer
to have access to their own IDIoTs.

Users have no rights on an IDIoT but those gently permitted by
its manifacturer. Even the end-of-life of an IDIoT can be remotely 
determined by closing its support service. The security and privacy
of users can be put in danger by IDIoT firmware bugs.

e.g.: Surveillance Cameras using cloud services, A smart TV is an IDIoT.

## Things for Smart Internet People (T4SIP)

The opposite of IDIoT is T4SIP: Things for Smart Internet People.

Level 1:
* the complete protocol of a T4SIP must be published
* a T4SIP must be able to use a user provided server

Level 2:
* the full description of a T4SIP hardware architecure is available
* the source code of the firmware is available as free (libre) code.
* T4SIP owners can generate a new firmware using a standard toolchain and can upload their new firmware on the device.
